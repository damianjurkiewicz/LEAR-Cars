## ℹ️ You need:

**If you’re just starting your journey with modding:**  
- [Essentials Pack](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/sa-essentials-pack/)  
*Without it:* you won’t be able to run any script mod.  

---

**Mandatory:**  
- [fastman92 limit adjuster](https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas/223963-fastman92-limit-adjuster.html) – improves stability. Requires a small configuration (see below).  
*Without it:* For some users you can **start a new game**, but **loading saved games will fail**.  


---

**Mandatory:**  
- [FastLoader](https://github.com/user-grinch/FastLoader/releases) – created specifically for Project Props 3; it loads `object.dat` lines for newly added objects and makes them breakable.  
*Without it:* Nothing serious, but newly added objects (e.g. road signs) won’t be breakable.  

---

**Mandatory:**  
- [VehFunc](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2025/09/sa-vehfuncs/) – created specifically for Project Props 3; it loads `object.dat` lines for newly added objects and makes them breakable.  
*Without it:* Nothing serious, but newly added objects (e.g. road signs) won’t be breakable.

**Highly Recommended:**  
- [Open Limit Adjuster v1.5.9](https://github.com/GTAmodding/III.VC.SA.LimitAdjuster/releases) – use with default settings  
*Without it:* Don’t even try.

## LEAR Cars - BETA - Model Extras, VehFunc, Soundize Car Adaptations for GTA San Andreas by Damix & Marchewa99XD

📦 **Part of Law Enforments Agencies Rework Mod**, aimed at **fixing original vehicles** and, most importantly, **immersively adding new cars** to the game.  
It focuses on **texture improvements, ModelExtras, VehFunc, and Soundize adaptations** — ensuring that every vehicle added to the game is fully consistent with its world and lore, without breaking immersion.

### 🚗Fixed Stock Cars & Immersive Custom Cars

- ✅ We add new vehicles **while also improving existing ones**, ensuring consistency and high quality across the game.  
- **Stock Counterparts for Emergency Vehicles** — every added emergency car has its civilian (stock) version. 
- **Improvements include:**
  - Realistic chrome, plastic, and metal materials  
  - Model fixes and reflection improvements  
  - Authentic glass reflections and new material systems  
- **Custom `vehicle3.txd` file** — every adapted model references this shared texture base for:
  - Unified visual style  
  - Lower memory usage  
  - Streamlined development workflow  
- **Revorked `vehicle.txd`** — a complete overhaul of the default file, delivering the best visual upgrade of its kind in the game’s history.  
- **Polygons Down — Immersion Up**  
  We chose not to add over-rounded wheels or unnecessary body smoothness. It breaks immersion and wastes performance — our approach respects the original game style.  
- **Texture Upscale & Mapping Fixes** — the highest-quality adaptation you can find, ensuring clean detail and realistic texture work.  
- **3D Steering Wheels** — lightweight, low-poly models crafted to match the original immersion style. 
- **Four Colors per Car for wheels and bumpers** — car in traffic have still classic immersive configurations, but you can get your style using in game tuning system.  
- **Working Mirrors** — realistic mirror reflections with accurate damage behavior.  
- **Classic Car Mods Restoration** — revival of iconic, long-forgotten community mods.

### ⚙️ ModelExtras Adaptations

- **Semi-Official ModelExtras Pack** — unlocking the full potential of ModelExtras.  
  We spent nearly a year collaborating with *Grinch*, testing solutions, proposing ideas, creating documentation, and designing the data file structure for easier installation.  
- **Functional Blinkers** — proper regional behavior: red for US vehicles, amber for EU/JDM cars.  
- **Reverse Lights** — accurately placed and calibrated based on original photos and references.  
- **Siren Rotators** — authentic corona effects and shadows, using a real mirror-rotation system — the first true-to-life implementation.  
- **Color Combinations** — more than 8 paint combinations per car, enabling proper variants with stripes and full-body color options.

### 🧰 VehFunc Adaptations

- Working windshield wipers  
- Recursive extras (dynamic and conditional extras)  
- Engine-linked vibration effects for parts  
- Functional rotating steering wheels  
- Authentic wiper animations with sound integration

### ⚡ Fastloader Adaptations

- **Plug-and-Play installation** — simply copy and paste into *modloader*  
- **No manual edits required** for:
  - `data/gtasa_vehicleAudioSettings.cfg` (audio config auto-handled)  
  - `data/cargrp.dat` (traffic spawning handled automatically)

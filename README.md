## ℹ️ You need:

**If you’re just starting your journey with modding:**  
- [Essentials Pack](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/sa-essentials-pack/)  
*Without it:* you won’t be able to run any script mod.

---
**Mandatory:** 
-[ModelExtras 2.0](https://github.com/user-grinch/ModelExtras) - this is the core of our mod 
*Without it:* Don't even try.
---

**Mandatory:**  
- [fastman92 limit adjuster](https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas/223963-fastman92-limit-adjuster.html) –   
*Without it: You won't be able to use added cars, so basically the core of this mod.  

---

**Mandatory:**  
- [FastLoader](https://github.com/user-grinch/FastLoader/releases) – created specifically for LEAR Cars; it loads `cargrp.dat` and `gtasa_vehicleAudioSettings.cfg` lines for newly added cars easly directly from the modloader. 
*Without it:* Cars won't have sound and they won't be present in the traffic.  

---

**Mandatory:**  
- [VehFunc](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2025/09/sa-vehfuncs/) – Many cool features for the cars, classic mod 
*Without it:* Game will crash.

---

**Highly Recommended:**  
- [Open Limit Adjuster v1.5.9](https://github.com/GTAmodding/III.VC.SA.LimitAdjuster/releases) – use with default settings  
*Without it:* Usage of FLA is simpler. Use default OLA settings, and unlock only necessary functions in FLA

**Optional:**  
- [Soundize](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2025/10/soundize/) – AAA Sound system for GTA SA - use it to feel full potential of our cars
*Without it:* Cars will only have default sounds.
